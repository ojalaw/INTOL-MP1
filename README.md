# INTOL

INTOL is a site that provides intelligence solutions for customers. There is an initial focus on 3 different capabilities, Imagery intelligence, Geospatial Intelligence and Open Source Intelligence. These types of intelligence are relatively unknown but with the right exposure, could be hugely beneficial to business/individuals condicting activities in a vulnerable area ir region. The website sheds light on what the different types of intelligence are, the products that can be created and the training that respective analysts go through to be qualified.

This is my Milestone Project 1 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website features five pages and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML and CSS.

Add multi device mockup generator.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

## Design


### Colour Scheme

The color scheme of the INTOL website is focused on shades of grey and white, with the following color variables defined in the CSS:

:root {
  --black: #000000;
  --offwhite: #fafafa;
  --white: #fff;
  --midgrey : #3a3a3a;
}


The use of these colors creates a clean and modern look that is easy on the eyes and helps to highlight the content on the website. In future updates, we may consider adding a bright color accent to the color scheme to create more visual interest.


### Typography

The INTOL website uses two Google Fonts for typography: Lato and Roboto. Lato is used for headings and titles, while Roboto is used for body text. Both fonts were chosen for their modern look and excellent legibility, which makes reading and navigation on the website easy and comfortable.


*Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?*


### Layout
The layout of the INTOL website is built using the Bootstrap framework, which provides a responsive grid system that allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The use of a grid system helps to create a consistent layout across all pages of the website, which makes navigation and exploration more intuitive for visitors.

### Future updates
As the INTOL website continues to evolve, we will continue to refine and improve the design based on feedback from our users and our own observations. We are committed to creating a website that is not only visually appealing but also easy to use and navigate, and we look forward to continuing to develop and improve our design over time.

Overall, the design of the INTOL website is clean, modern, and easy to use. We believe that our color scheme, typography, layout, and other visual elements help to communicate the values and capabilities of INTOL in a clear and compelling way, and we look forward to continuing to refine and improve our design in the future.
