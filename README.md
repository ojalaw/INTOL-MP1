# INTOL

INTOL is a site that provides intelligence solutions for customers. There is an initial focus on 3 different capabilities, Imagery intelligence, Geospatial Intelligence and Open Source Intelligence. These types of intelligence are relatively unknown but with the right exposure, could be hugely beneficial to business/individuals condicting activities in a vulnerable area ir region. The website sheds light on what the different types of intelligence are, the products that can be created and the training that respective analysts go through to be qualified.

This is my Milestone Project 1 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website features five pages and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML and CSS.

Add multi device mockup generator.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.
