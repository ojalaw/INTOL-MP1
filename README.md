# INTOL

INTOL is a site that provides intelligence solutions for customers. There is an initial focus on 3 different capabilities, Imagery intelligence, Geospatial Intelligence and Open Source Intelligence. These types of intelligence are relatively unknown but with the right exposure, could be hugely beneficial to business/individuals condicting activities in a vulnerable area ir region. The website sheds light on what the different types of intelligence are, the products that can be created and the training that respective analysts go through to be qualified.

This is Milestone Project 1 for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. This website features five pages and is built using technologies that I have learnt since staring the course including HTML and CSS and also contains Javascript.

## Design


### Colour Scheme

The color scheme of the INTOL website is focused on shades of grey and white, with the following color variables defined in the CSS:

![alt text](README-images/color-wheel.png "Optional title")

The use of these colors creates a clean and modern look that is easy on the eyes and helps to highlight the content on the website. In future updates, we may consider adding a bright color accent to the color scheme to create more visual interest.


### Typography

The INTOL website uses two Google Fonts for typography: Lato and Roboto. Lato is used for headings and titles, while Roboto is used for body text. Both fonts were chosen for their modern look and excellent legibility, which makes reading and navigation on the website easy and comfortable.

### Layout
The layout of the INTOL website is built using the Bootstrap framework, which provides a responsive grid system that allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The use of a grid system helps to create a consistent layout across all pages of the website, which makes navigation and exploration more intuitive for visitors.

### Imagery

I spent a great deal of time when it came to selecting the images for use on the site. I believe that the images chosen are consistent with the general design theme of the site and are all of the highest quality possible. All images have been compressed to speed up processing times, predominantly on mobile devices.

Imagery on the site was sourced from Shutterstock and Adobestock and Pixabay.


### Wireframes

![INTOL Wireframe](README-images/Initial-INTOL-Wireframe.pdf "Optional title")

### Future updates
As the INTOL website continues to evolve, we will continue to refine and improve the design based on feedback from our users and our own observations. We are committed to creating a website that is not only visually appealing but also easy to use and navigate, and we look forward to continuing to develop and improve our design over time.

Overall, the design of the INTOL website is clean, modern, and easy to use. We believe that our color scheme, typography, layout, and other visual elements help to communicate the values and capabilities of INTOL in a clear and compelling way, and we look forward to continuing to refine and improve our design in the future.

I purposely chose to keep this page is simplistic as possible, inlcluding Fontawesome icons to make the site more visually appealing.

![alt text](README-images/about-us-readme.png "Optional title")

The purpose of this page was to be more informative than visually appealing, I appreciate that this could be achieved by using images/other methods, however i didn't want my site to be made up solely by CSS and images and felt that it was necessary to include text on the 'About us' Page.

**Capabilities**
The capabilities page contains information about INTOL's three main intelligence capabilities: IMINT, GEOINT, and OSINT.
Each capability is presented in a section with an image and a description of the technique used and the products produced.
The page also includes a section on future capabilities, with information about INTOL's plans to offer cyber, financial, and human intelligence services.
The sections on the page alternate the side of the page they appear on for an appealing flow, I went with a symbolic approach with the spherical capability images, i wanted them to appear as though they were viewed through a spy glass in keeping with the intelligence theme.

![alt text](README-images/capability-readme.png "Optional title")

**Opportunities**
Title: The title of the page is "Opportunities". It appears at the top of the page and provides users with a clear idea of what the page is about.
Information about Recruitment: The page provides information about a recruitment drive for an office setting up in London, as well as IMINT positions that will be opening up in Q3 2023.
Image Zoom: The page features an image zoom function that allows users to zoom in on an image by hovering their mouse over it. This is achieved through the use of JavaScript.
Images: The page contains two images, one of a crowd at a sports stadium and another of an IA analysis.
Test: The page features a test in which users are asked to find a specific object in an image.
Call-to-action: The page includes a call-to-action button that encourages users to subscribe for more information about job opportunities at INTOL.

Overall, the page is designed to provide users with information about job opportunities at INTOL, as well as to encourage them to subscribe for more information. It makes use of various design features, such as a navigation bar, images, and a call-to-action button, to engage users and make it easy for them to find the information they need.

**Subscribe**
Form section: The page contains a form that users can fill out to subscribe to the INTOL newsletter and receive more information about the company. The form includes fields for the user's first and last name, email address, and comments. There is also a section for users to select their intelligence preference (OSINT, IMINT, GEOINT, or All) using checkboxes.
Subscribe button: At the bottom of the form, there is a button that users can click to submit their subscription information.

### Content

Other than the code previously mentioned in the code used section, I was responsible for writing all of the content for the website. Although this is a genuine business idea, at this stage, the company and associated training, recruitment fairs are ficticious, however there are elements of truth in capabilities.
