## Lighthouse Testing  

I used lighthouse testing via Google Chrome Developer Tools and PageSpeed Insights.  

The site is tested against the following criteria;  

Performance  
Accessibility  
Best Practices  
SEO  


First lighthouse testing highlighted issues surrounding image size, they were subsequently compressed.

## Bug Reporting

There were a few bugs discovered during the intial testing. I hadn't tested the responsiveness of the site on medium/large screens extensively and as a result;  
- iframes overflowed the container.  
- Form on the subscription page was not responsive in the way I orginally intended.  
- Images on the opportunity page were not responsive.  
- The nav bar was very cluttered on smaller screens meaning i needed to change the breakpoint for the collapsible navbar.
